Successfully implemented the markers on each Red Line station, as well as implemented a red polyline showing the path of the Red Line. There are custom markers for the stations as well.

Successfully implemented a marker for the user's location. Got the polyline connecting the user's location to the nearest MBTA Station working as well. Clicking on a station should show the upcoming trains.

I got help from the Google Maps API documentation.

This took me about 3-4 hours.
