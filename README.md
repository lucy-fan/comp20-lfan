COMP 20 Summer 2018 Private Repo for Lucy Fan

The purpose of this git repository was to be able to submit my work for my COMP 20 class for review. 
This repository contains all my completed work for the class.

My favorite lab was the rickroll one. 
I enjoyed working with javascript for the first time and I also enjoy "Never Going to Give You Up" by Rick Astley.

I learned a lot from this course. 
This course gave me a lot of insight into how the Internet functions.
Whether through learning about HTML requests, working with MongoDB, and developing functional and useful web applications, this course introduced me to the world of programming for the Internet, and it has been very useful for me as a frequent Internet user.

Now that I've finished the course, I would like to delve deeper into making web applications not only more interactive, but pretty. 
Even though CSS isn't considered something difficult, I want to figure out how to make my websites look really nice.
Hopefully my portfolio will look nice soon!
