I've successfully implemented the JSON parsing that goes on the page, as well as successfully being able to insert the line break between the two messages. 

Successfully used XMLHTTPRequest to get the JSON data and parsed it.

CSS does not work quite yet. Am working on it.

I worked on this code alone.

This took me about 1 hour.
