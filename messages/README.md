I've successfully implemented the JSON parsing that goes on the page, as well as successfully being able to insert the line break between the two messages. 

Successfully used XMLHTTPRequest to get the JSON data and parsed it.

When I open it using localhost, it works. However, it does not work when I open index or when I replace data.json with the url - there are no messages. 

It is not possible to request data from a different origin because of 

I worked on this code alone.

This took me about 1 hour.
